Description: In this app you will explore how a significance test relates to a confidence interval.
LearningObjectives: c(
    "The student will learn that the alternative hypothesis dictates the type of
    confidence interval created.",
    "The student will learn that when the p-value is smaller than the significance
    level, the null value falls outside of the confidence interval.",
    "The student will learn that increasing the confidence level will increase 
    the width of the interval."
